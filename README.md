It is a simple web-based application that allows users to input numbers into a 3x3 grid and automatically calculates the sum of the numbers both horizontally (rows) and vertically (columns). The application uses JavaScript to dynamically update the sum fields in real-time as the user enters or changes values. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface for basic arithmetic operations.
